Note


answer 1-- git restore basically use for undo your last commit and its give you the data form previous commits,
it will be  revert the file back to its previous state,;

git restore --staged filename=== if you do some modification in your files and commit them but you realsize,
there are some bugs in your file so you don't wanna push it and you want to work in bugs so you just do git restore 
-- staged filename , it will remove that file from staging area and the modification will be the same in your
local system it would be present,.


This would remove the "example.txt" file from the staging area, so that any changes you make to the file would 
not be included in the next commit. However, any modifications you made to the file itself would still be present,
 so you could continue working on the file and make further changes before committing.
